# Sunflower
An embedded system rotating a payload towards sunlight implemented in assembly.

All info can be found in the [report](/report/report.pdf).
        
## Core Components
- All computational operations and control signals are managed by a **PIC16F1780 Microcontroller**.
- The light detection is managed by a **Quadsensor** composed of **four LDRs**.
- The vertical rotation is managed by a **closed loop type servomotor (180°)** and the horizontal rotation by an **open loop type servomotor (360°)**.
